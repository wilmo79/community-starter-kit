### How you can help

There are many ways you can help us make this project better. Every repository is different and our goal is to create an app that is flexible enough to help most repositories, while still being easy for new app users to grok. If you would like to help, we use labels to organize the work that needs to be done. Look for the labels that fit your expertise:

- **development-needed**: do you have development skills in the toolset? Please help :raised_hands:
- **qa-needed**: Testing is life, write scipts, push the app
- **documentation-needed**: Technical writers make the project usable
- **bug-high-priority**: this is a high impact bug; requires focus now
- **bug-low-priority**: should be fixed when high priorty is clear 
- **help-wanted**: We're not sure how to fix, anyone out there?

You can also help by translating documentation and reviewing open pull requests.
